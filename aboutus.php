							<h2>The goal of our project</h2>
							<p>
								The purpose of creating this site is to create a tool that allows you to automate some of the important work points of a university teacher.The teacher Nargiz Oguzbayeva has 7 groups and more than 150 students. Because of so many groups, it is very difficult for her to convey information on her subject to each student. This took away a lot of her personal time, and also littered her personal phone with unnecessary data. Now, thanks to this site, the teacher will be able to easily place teaching materials and tasks for students, without worrying about the fact that they will not have the opportunity.
